# Project State: Karaí

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)
**Core value:** El happy path completo funciona de punta a punta en la demo: PyME sube factura → se evalúa riesgo con BCRA + IA → inversores fondean fracciones → plataforma liquida y distribuye capital + intereses.
**Current focus:** Phase 4

## Current Status

- **Phase:** 4 — Settlement, Dashboards & Demo Polish
- **Status:** Completed
- **Milestone:** v1
- **Current plan:** Phase 4 Complete

## Decisions

- 2026-03-28 Phase 3 keeps marketplace contracts type-only so UI/realtime layers share one stable funding shape.
- 2026-03-28 Expected return previews use proportional invoice math from fraction net amount versus invoice net and face value.
- 2026-03-28 Marketplace query utilities stay dependency-injectable so Vitest can validate server reads without a Next request scope.
- [Phase 03]: Kept fund_invoice() as the only purchase write path so marketplace buys stay race-safe inside the database.
- [Phase 03]: Rejected short-supply requests instead of partially filling so Phase 3 purchases remain deterministic.
- [Phase 03]: Published invoices and fractions to supabase_realtime so dashboard and detail views share one live funding source.
- 2026-03-28 Purchase validation now lives in one server action before any `fund_invoice()` RPC call.
- 2026-03-28 Marketplace clients prefer invoice subscriptions and only fall back to 2-second polling when channel health drops.
- 2026-03-28 Funding progress, return preview, and realtime status now render through shared marketplace widgets.
- 2026-03-28 `/inversor/dashboard` remains the single investor landing route and now renders the live funding marketplace.
- 2026-03-28 Shared marketplace read-model serialization now powers both server queries and browser polling refreshes.
- 2026-03-28 Investor detail pages can stay live with typed funding snapshots while purchases submit through the server action boundary.
- 2026-03-28 Marketplace realtime views now auto-fallback to polling if a channel never reaches `SUBSCRIBED`.
- [Phase 04]: Settlement remains a single Supabase RPC so invoice transitions, row locks, and ledger writes stay atomic.
- [Phase 04]: fund_invoice() now emits the cedente disbursement at 100% funding and settle_invoice() backfills it only for historical funded invoices missing that ledger row.
- [Phase 04]: Settlement interest allocation gives the final locked fraction the cent-level remainder so payout totals always equal the invoice spread.
- [Phase 04]: Settlement dashboards and detail views now share one server read-model that normalizes events plus transactions into audited timeline items.
- [Phase 04]: Invoice detail and dashboard routes stay stable while layering settlement summaries, transaction history, and post-purchase holdings onto the existing role surfaces.
- [Phase 04]: Phase 4 validation relies on one deterministic desktop/mobile Playwright happy path, plus MCP corroboration and an explicit Vercel fallback when linkage or auth is missing.

## Current Readiness

- Phase 2 validation artifact: `.planning/phases/02-invoice-origination-risk-engine/02-VALIDATION.md`
- Phase 3 funding boundary is live: `public.fund_invoice()` now locks invoice and fraction rows, inserts purchase ledger records, and transitions invoices to `funded` at 100%.
- Phase 3 Plan 01 summary: `.planning/phases/03-marketplace-funding/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase 3 Plan 02 summary: `.planning/phases/03-marketplace-funding/03-02-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase 3 Plan 03 summary: `.planning/phases/03-marketplace-funding/03-03-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase 3 Plan 04 summary: `.planning/phases/03-marketplace-funding/03-04-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase 3 Plan 05 summary: `.planning/phases/03-marketplace-funding/03-05-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase 3 validation artifact: `.planning/phases/03-marketplace-funding/03-VALIDATION.md`
- Phase 4 Plan 01 summary: `.planning/phases/04-settlement-dashboards-demo-polish/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase 4 Plan 02 summary: `.planning/phases/04-settlement-dashboards-demo-polish/04-02-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase 4 Plan 03 summary: `.planning/phases/04-settlement-dashboards-demo-polish/04-03-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase 4 Plan 04 summary: `.planning/phases/04-settlement-dashboards-demo-polish/04-04-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase 4 Plan 05 summary: `.planning/phases/04-settlement-dashboards-demo-polish/04-05-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase 4 validation artifact: `.planning/phases/04-settlement-dashboards-demo-polish/04-VALIDATION.md`
- Phase 4 settlement boundary is live: `public.settle_invoice()` now transitions `funded -> settling -> settled`, writes settlement ledger rows, and backfills missing cedente disbursements safely.
- `public.fund_invoice()` now inserts exactly one `disbursement_to_cedente` row when funding reaches 100%.
- Cedente and investor dashboards now render settlement-era metrics, holdings, diversification, and transaction history from one server query layer.
- Invoice detail routes now stay useful through settlement with full lifecycle timelines, financial summaries, and role-aware history.
- Local Phase 4 desktop/mobile gate passed end-to-end; deployed Vercel replay remains undocumented only because repo linkage and CLI auth are unavailable in this environment.
- Known external caveat: live BCRA probe paths still return 404 from this environment, so the happy path intentionally uses the pre-warmed cache + deterministic engine.
